      <description>Analysis  Summary How I Got That Name by Marilyn Chin is a poem where she explores the issue of her culture being part of both the east and the west. She explores the issue of her name - there is both an English component and a Chinese component. She explores how she believes that even if she tries to avoid her Chinese roots in the USA, it will only come back to her at an even stronger intensity.</description>
