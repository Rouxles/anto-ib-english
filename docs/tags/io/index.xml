      <description>In this post, I&#39;ll essentially be reflecting on how I got to my global issue, and the general problems/solutions I had while doing my IO.
Getting to my global issue I was very interested in the Nike advertisements studied earlier in the year due to the message hitting home for me (I had to endure some hardships in terms of not being able to chase some of my dreams), so I felt like for my global issue, I wanted to explore how authors explored these issues with the way they portrayed the text.</description>

      <description>Recently I did the Mini IO as part of a school summative assessment (notes for which can be found here), and scored pretty poorly on it. However, here are some general notes that I can follow in order to improve my performance for next time:
 Explicitly state your global issue right from the beginning  Identify how it&#39;s presented in the text in the introduction (ie this issue is widespread globally because x)   Clearly signpost your work (this needs particular work)  I will divide this into 3 main arguments, x, y and z.</description>
