      <description>This was my first assignment done on CommonLit.
Here are a few notes that I have taken on the article:
 PAF  P: This article was made primarily to inform readers about what successful people + businesses do in order to stay afloat in rough times, and how certain traits can lead to success. A: As this article was part of the Harvard Business Review, this would lead to a more business-focused article - ie more of the text would be based around the idea of how businesses apply resilience and what they look for in candidates F: A long first person article about many examples (and 3 different traits) of resilience.</description>
