      <title>The Phoenix Gone</title>

      <description>Analysis  Reflection I did not enjoy this poem at all. It was way too long for my tastes, and I felt like there wasn&#39;t too much content that struck me (essentially, a lot of filler content). However, the end of the poem was a hard hitting one for me.
 &amp;ldquo;yellow crowfoot in the pond, not lotus, not lily&amp;rdquo;
 This was hard hitting for me as it made me remember to be grateful for what I have, and to not take anything for granted again.</description>

      <description>Analysis  Reflection Repulse Bay was quite a hard-hitting poem for me. Chin doesn&#39;t feel quite at home with her culture, and is stuck between two boundaries - Western culture and Chinese culture. I myself am also part of this cultural shift, with the modern Hong Kong being less integrated with Chinese culture, and more integrated with international culture. I think one aspect of it can be seen with public holidays.</description>

      <title>How I Got That Name</title>

      <description>Analysis  Summary How I Got That Name by Marilyn Chin is a poem where she explores the issue of her culture being part of both the east and the west. She explores the issue of her name - there is both an English component and a Chinese component. She explores how she believes that even if she tries to avoid her Chinese roots in the USA, it will only come back to her at an even stronger intensity.</description>
