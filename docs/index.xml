The advertisement aims to inform readers about the project, and also gives readers a chance to reflect on how fortunate they are to live with effortless access to water.

 In ‘Persepolis’ by Marjane Satrapi, the ubiquitous global issue of political oppression is a recurring motif. In the chapter ‘The Passport’, Satrapi uses linguistic and graphical features in subtle manners as vehicles to illustrate her ideas on the political environment in Iran, as well as the lack of freedom that people get in such environments.
