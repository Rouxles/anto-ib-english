<p>The Passport (page 118)
Global Issue: The impacts of political oppression on families.</p>

<hr />

<p>In ‘Persepolis’ by Marjane Satrapi, the ubiquitous global issue of political oppression is a recurring motif. In the chapter ‘The Passport’, Satrapi uses Marjane, her uncle Taher and Niloufar as a vehicle to suggest her ideas on the political environment in Iran, as well as the lack of freedom that people get in such environments.</p>

<p>To begin with, on the bottom right panel on page 122 (Satrapi, 2009), showing Marjane’s mother and Taher’s wife embracing on one half of the panel, along with Marjane and her father on the other half of the panel, both with contrasting negative spaces. Satrapi shows how escaping a political environment is better than staying in a politically oppressed environment. Often, Satrapi uses black negative space to suggest negativity and a feeling of isolation and confinement. This panel is no different. On the left half of the panel, Marjane’s mother and Taher’s wife are shown to be embracing each other, trying to calm themselves down after Taher’s third heart attack, but they aren’t able to do anything about it, particularly because the border was closed, and Taher would need to leave the country in order to have open heart surgery. On the contrary, the other half of the panel shows Marjane and her father leaving to Khosro’s house in order to get a forged passport for uncle Taher. This act shows rebellion against the government, and this is accompanied with white negative space - the only appearance of it in the page - depicting hope when trying to rebel against the government. This is further emphasized with the exclamatory “We’ll be right back” (Satrapi, 2009, page 122), which suggests the excitement and hope of Marjane and her father to readers.</p>

<p>In addition, the bottom three panels on page 123 (Satrapi, 2009) further shows the political oppression of the government on the citizens of Iran. These panels show Niloufar, a communist being chased away by the government. Government oppression is further suggested through speech, by stating that the government has been searching the houses of everyone in Niloufar’s family, showing the depths to which the government is willing to go to in order to ‘erase’ citizens with opposing and ‘dangerous’ views. In the panels, Niloufar is the only person dressed in white clothes, further emphasizing the opposing views that Niloufar has, as well as focusing the reader’s attention on her, paralleling the government’s focus on Niloufar.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the middle three panels on page 125 (Satrapi, 2009) further brings the issue of political oppression to light through ___</p>

<p>(additionally, the exclamatory - hope)</p>
