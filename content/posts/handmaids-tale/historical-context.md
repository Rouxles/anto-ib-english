Atwood has written that her research on 17th-century American Puritans, who created a rigid and inhumane theocracy based on a few **choice selections from the Bible**, influenced Gilead. But the novel also responds to the **modern political scene in America**. The religious right, with its **moralizing** tendencies, was gaining power in America as backlash to the **left-wing Free Love and feminist movements**. In the 1970’s, Jerry Falwell and other Christian leaders urged the Republican party to **bring prayer back to schools, diminish abortion rights, and defeat the Equal Rights Amendment**, which was meant to support women. The Handmaid’s Tale shows how **religion can be used as an excuse to reduce women’s rights**, a political tendency which continues to occur all over the world. (From LitCharts)

1. The story that Offred tells and how it helps to explain the structure of the narrative
   1. Oppression of women's rights - how they're not able to express themselves. This happens due to religion - which mirrored how right wing politicians thought both historically and in the modern world.
   2. The structure of the narrative keeps returning back to the "night" sections, with a few daytime events in between. This means that Offred values these "night" chapters far more than everything else (as it's a constant), and this could be because that's the only portion where Offred can express herself and talk to the other women.
2. The character of Offred herself?
   1. Offred is rebellious, and full of passionate memories. She also has keen observations and shows honest emotions, showing to readers that the brainwashing that Gilead attempted to do on society had little to no power over Offred.
