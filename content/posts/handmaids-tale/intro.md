The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood is set in the U.S. after a revolution. The values go from the current democratic ones to those of Christianity from the Old Testament (a lot of prejudice, especially towards women).

This was written shortly after the elections of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher (both are conservative political figures), who were partially fuelled by the conservative revolution. These conservatives criticized the sexual revolution, so feminists were naturally afraid that their progress would be all for nothing. The Handmaid's Tale highlights those concerns in an extremely dystopian fashion.

Connections between the 2016-2020 presidency and Atwood's concerns can be seen due to conservative values (for example with regards to immigration, race, and women's control over their own body - in other words, abortion).

P11 On PDF:

The location is a high school gymnasium that has been converted into the “Rachel and Leah” education center. Why is the name significant? (Think back to the epigraph).
- This is significant because it's an old testament biblical reference (which is part of the book's context) - and talks about "handmaids" and loss of control over one's body - which is what society wanted at the time - women to not have control over their own body.
- Interestingly enough, the high school gymnasium is very old-school (makes sense considering when the book was released), which is why I couldn't see a strong connection to a HS gymnasium on my first read.

How are we given clues of this dystopian world in the first few pages? Comment on the effect or meaning of this. After we have collected some notes, we will discuss. 
- Not being able to speak - set up in rows so "we" could not talk
- Barbed wire
- Electric cattle prods slung on the patrollers.
- "Specially picked from the angels" - no control over anything in their lives
- Learnt how to whisper without sound + lip read - not needed in a modern society
- Contrast between the relative utopia of before and present day times.
- "still had our bodies"

Ex: “Dances would have been held there, the music lingered, a palimpsest of unheard sound”-- “Palimpsest” means a piece of paper or a manuscript that has been erased and rewritten upon. This suggests that this world has completely changed, and history has been “erased”. What was once a high school is now a “re-education center”.
