All of the contexts/themes in The Handmaid's Tale are brought from historical records - none of it is made up.

[Article](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20180425-why-the-handmaids-tale-is-so-relevant-today)

- Aspects of life in 1985 which directed Atwood’s thinking
  - Election of Ronald Reagan as U.S. president (embrace of conservatism) + increasing power of extremist Christian organizations 
    -  "The backlash against abortion in the US at the time included a widely distributed propaganda video called ‘The Silent Scream,’ a **rash of abortion clinic bombings and arson cases** and a proposed law that would give foetuses civil rights protections. The Reagan administration also broke with longstanding policy and declared that the US government **would fund only international women's health groups that promoted ‘natural’ family planning** – that is, abstinence – in underdeveloped countries"
- The writer's opinion on why the novel retains relevance today
  - The modern film adaptation by Hulu (released after Donald Trump got elected) still had issues from the book that were paralleled in real life (for example with Mike Pence's anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ+ stance).
  - The first film adaptation showed the issues that society had - studios didn't want to put out a primarily female movie + many major actresses were afraid of the radical views that the book had.
