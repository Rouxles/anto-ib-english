This was my first assignment done on CommonLit.

Here are a few notes that I have taken on the article:

- PAF
  - P: This article was made primarily to inform readers about what successful people + businesses do in order to stay afloat in rough times, and how certain traits can lead to success.
  - A: As this article was part of the *Harvard Business Review*, this would lead to a more business-focused article - ie more of the text would be based around the idea of how businesses apply resilience and what they look for in candidates
  - F: A long first person article about many examples (and 3 different traits) of resilience.
