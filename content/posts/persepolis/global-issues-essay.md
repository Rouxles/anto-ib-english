The Passport (page 118)
Global Issue: The impacts of political oppression on families.

---

In ‘Persepolis’ by Marjane Satrapi, the ubiquitous global issue of political oppression is a recurring motif. In the chapter ‘The Passport’, Satrapi uses linguistic and graphical features in subtle manners as vehicles to illustrate her ideas on the political environment in Iran, as well as the lack of freedom that people get in such environments.

To begin with, on the bottom right panel on page 122 (Satrapi, 2009), Satrapi shows the negative side of a politically oppressed environment. The left half of the panel shows Marjane’s mother and Taher’s wife embracing each other with black negative space behind them, which is a feature often used by Satrapi to connote isolation and confinement. On the contrary, the right half of the panel shows Marjane and her father running away, which is accompanied with white negative space - the only appearance of it on the page - showing readers that Marjane and her father felt hope at the time. This is further emphasized with the exclamatory “We’ll be right back” (Satrapi, 2009, page 122), which emphasizes the excitement and hope that Marjane and her father had due to the potential chance of liberation.

In addition, the bottom right panel on page 123 (Satrapi, 2009) further showcases the political oppression on the citizens of Iran. Niloufar, a communist, lived in Khosro’s house because she was wanted by the government due to her opposing views. The panel shows Niloufar wearing a white dress, while Khosro, as well as Marjane and her father in the previous panels wearing black. The use of contrasting colours makes readers focus their attention on Niloufar, which parallels the government’s targeting of her, further illustrating Satrapi’s thoughts on political oppression. Additionally, the linguistic features further suggests political oppression, as the government were “searching the houses of everyone in [Niloufar’s] family”, which makes readers visualise the lengths to which the government is willing to go in order to detain citizens with opposing views to the government, vividly showing Satrapi’s ideas about freedom in politically oppressed environments.

Furthermore, the right panel on the middle row of page 125 (Satrapi, 2009) shows Khosro seeking asylum in a distant country. After Niloufar is caught by the government and executed, Khosro found his house ransacked, and had to “[seek] asylum with his brother in Sweden”. The use of the proper noun “Sweden” allows readers to understand the distances that Khosro needed to go to in order to free himself from the grasp of the government. Additionally, Satrapi uses a shadow to cover Khosro’s face in the frame, suggesting that he still needs to hide himself from the government, even though he’s thousands of kilometers away from Iran. This illustrates the constant paranoia that those under political oppression are undergoing, further showing the lack of freedom citizens have.

In conclusion, Satrapi effectively explores the issue of political oppression by showcasing the contrast between Iran and freedom, as well as the lengths to which the government is willing to go in order to erase people with opposing viewpoints.
