## Analysis

## Reflection

I did not enjoy this poem at all. It was way too long for my tastes, and I felt like there wasn't too much content that struck me (essentially, a lot of filler content). However, the end of the poem was a hard hitting one for me. 

> "yellow crowfoot in the pond, not lotus, not lily"

This was hard hitting for me as it made me remember to be grateful for what I have, and to not take anything for granted again. Even if Chin's life was not like "lotus" or "lily", signs of growth and renewal, her life was like a "yellow crowfoot", not as beautiful as that of a lotus or lily, but certainly beautiful nonetheless. Essentially, I saw that part of the poem as Chin being thankful for what she has, almost not wishing for anything different to happen to her.
