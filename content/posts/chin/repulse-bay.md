## Analysis

## Reflection

Repulse Bay was quite a hard-hitting poem for me. Chin doesn't feel quite at home with her culture, and is stuck between two boundaries - Western culture and Chinese culture. I myself am also part of this cultural shift, with the modern Hong Kong being less integrated with Chinese culture, and more integrated with international culture. I think one aspect of it can be seen with public holidays. Hong Kong celebrates western holidays as well as Chinese holidays, and due to limitations with the number of holidays you can give to people (due to work), Hong Kong does have to cut some Chinese holidays from its calendar. Additionally, I don't experience as much Hong Kong culture as I would have if I wasn't studying in an international school. I don't speak as much Cantonese, and I don't get to experience how most people go through school (through the HKDSE curriculum). However, I am thankful for being exposed to these many cultures, and am glad that I was born in this way.
