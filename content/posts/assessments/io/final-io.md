In this post, I'll essentially be reflecting on how I got to my global issue, and the general problems/solutions I had while doing my IO.

## Getting to my global issue

I was very interested in the Nike advertisements studied earlier in the year due to the message hitting home for me (I had to endure some hardships in terms of not being able to chase some of my dreams), so I felt like for my global issue, I wanted to explore how authors explored these issues with the way they portrayed the text.

As a result of this, I decided to use a Nike advertisement. In terms of picking the fiction text, while the issue is perhaps more obvious in Persepolis, I felt like in Frankenstein, both Mary Shelley and Gris Grimly portray the monster in a subtle manner, and the message from Frankenstein hit home harder than it did for Persepolis.

Therefore, I came to my global issue: The treatment of individuals who are different to what society expects of them.

## Research for texts

### Frankenstein

Mary Shelly wrote Frankenstein in 1818 during the scientific revolution, and at the time, science was believed to have no limits, so Mary Shelly essentially wanted to highlight how scientists at the time shouldn't really be chasing scientific goals only for the fame, but should also consider the potential consequences of doing so. Even in this day and age, this issue still holds true, with machine learning and AI being the next new thing, with potential life changing impacts, both positive or negative. This book was also written for a competition with her husband, and additionally, Mary Shelley cared about gender equality.

For Gris Grimly, drew the illustrations for Frankenstein in 2013, and was especially drawn towards illustrating Frankenstein due to his own personal life experiences. He has revealed in an interview that he was 80% burnt on his back at the age of 5, and as a result, was rejected from his own society - in this case, his classmates - and thus, he felt like the monster growing up. With this, readers are able to see Grimly's own life experiences in the monster's life, albeit with quite significant differences.

### Nike Advertisements

In 2017, Nike released a series of advertisements in Russia, Turkey and the Middle East in order to promote women's sports, and give women in the future generation a platform to chase their dreams. Nike has revealed in an interview that the advertisements were not only for emboldening the next generation to shift how society saw women's sports, but also to celebrate the achievements of women who were able to achieve athletic milestones in such an oppressive society.

## Links to GI

In Nike's case, the link to the global issue is quite obvious, so it'll be left out here.

For Frankenstein, there is an extract (P107-P108) where the idea of the Monster being rejected due to his appearance is fully shown. Initially, a blind man talks compassionately to the monster, due to his inability to see, but the moment another man walks in, he attacks the monster due to the monster's appearance.

## Authorial Choices

In Nike's case, for all the advertisements as part of the larger campaign, they took a traditional issue/question/song, and flipped it on its head to empower and motivate women to keep chasing their dreams. For example, in the Middle Eastern advertisement, "What will they say about you?" is a common question used by society in order to instil fear in women, and the fact that this is used as the opener for the advertisement sets the tone of the advertisement as being something almost dehumanizing women. However, shortly thereafter, the advertisement's language morphs to empower women instead, telling women about how they could be called "strong", or "make [actions] look easy".

For Frankenstein, the use of a graphic novel allows Grimly to both express the story through words and illustration. Additionally, as a graphic novel can't possibly include every single moment of a scene, much of the content of the graphic novel is up to the reader's interpretation, which allows them to create their own version of the story visually - which is both more accessible and more importantly, more vivid and easier to remember. In this way, readers can interpret the story personally, and see the issues that arise in the book in their own way.

## Oral comments

Generally went well, but discourse markers could have possibly been used more. (Should be filled in more detail at a later date.)
