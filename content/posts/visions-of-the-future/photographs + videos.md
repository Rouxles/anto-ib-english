## Question 

We study photojournalism in LangLit because the IBO defines photographs as a type of ‘text’. Based on what we have explored today, why do you think this might be the case?

There's a pretty famous quote - "A photo is worth a thousand words", and thus, photojournalism can state a lot even without many words. Especially with the quality of current photography, as well as the multitude of global issues around the world, photographs in the modern world are as important as they have ever been, being able to move people emotionally (for example with a war photograph single-handedly being able to sway public opinion on the Vietnam war.)

The photos by Bleasdale on photojournalism (about his work in DR Congo) can be reflected in Josh Haner's work.

Josh Haner's work primarily deals with nature. His work is more along the lines of the beauty of nature, where the audience can see the images and realize through pathos that the world is beautiful, however due to personal knowledge that the audience may have, they are able to connect the idea of humanity destroying nature with the beauty of these photographs, and see the importance in preserving nature.

- The statistics can be believed because of these specific reasons:
  - The video is from National Geographic (Logos - authority figure + have a track record of being trustworthy)
  - The videos kind of reflect what's going on in real life (pictures + videos show ice caps melting/national disasters etc)
- The music used is chosen carefully to influence + amplify emotions produced
