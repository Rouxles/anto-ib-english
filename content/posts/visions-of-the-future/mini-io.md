Recently I did the Mini IO as part of a school summative assessment (notes for which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19sOXlDLbAxYXsmnmJSoeQA7LeDYfN6rYoYsuNVlklTo/edit?usp=sharing)), and scored pretty poorly on it. However, here are some general notes that I can follow in order to improve my performance for next time:

1. Explicitly state your global issue right from the beginning
   1. Identify how it's presented in the text in the introduction (ie this issue is widespread globally because x)
2. Clearly signpost your work (this needs particular work)
   1. I will divide this into 3 main arguments, x, y and z.
3. Context (production/reception) wasn't really mentioned in enough detail within the texts themselves
