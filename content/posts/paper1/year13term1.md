### Summary + Self-reported Feedback

1. When going for your examples/evidence, please be more specific
   1. Instead of just the boy's face showing helplessness, say how this works (for example, the boy's mouth is wide open with half-closed eyes - looks very weak cupped in his mother's eyes etc)
2. Make sure to mention more on PAF/COP/COR at the start of the text and be more explicit when pointing these things out
3. Instead of going for something on a global scale when analysing, analyse how it affects the text instead.
4. Make sure whenever you're making a point, there is ALWAYS analysis that goes with it.
5. Definitely work more on Criterion A and B more so than C and D
   1. Learn how to analyse images in essence.
