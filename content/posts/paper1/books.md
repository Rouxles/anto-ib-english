## Introduction

In 'The Pleasure of Books', a radio address by William Lyon Phelps, figurative and rhetorical devices are used in order to offer comfort to readers, who had just gone through the great depression. Phelps also makes assumptions that listeners enjoy reading books, and have the means and desire to build a collection of them. Through this, Phelps gets his audience hooked into reading and experiencing the unique feeling of reading books.

This address was made during the great depression, meaning that Phelps used his platform as an opportunity to motivate his audience, and give them a means of escape. Phelps alludes that reading a book is "like visiting a forest". The use of the simile here makes listeners visualize how reading is a form of entertainment to the point where they are able to escape to another world with it, and not have to worry about their current life during the great depression.
