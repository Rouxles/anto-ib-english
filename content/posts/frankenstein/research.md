### Romanticism

Some example writers in the romantic period would be Wordsworth or Shelley.

- What are the main features of Romanticism?
  - There is a large emphasis on emotive and **imaginative** imagery
  - Against rigidity
  - *Limmal Space* - be aware of this
  - Naturalism - folk tales
  - Self-expression and individual feeling matters - the expression of the poet's own thoughts is vital to romanticism.
    - Exploring the 'truth of thoughts' is more important than expressing the scientific truth
  - Nature plays a large part in the content of the pieces, and are often expected to be painted in a way which sees nature not as just a scientific truth, but a living being.
    - Wordsworth's poems are great examples of these concepts.
  - Sometimes, the romantics would use the past eras (medieval, Greek/Roman mythology etc) for inspiration on their own poems.
- What is Romanticism reacting against?
  - Romanticism was developed as a style going against the simpler and more rigid neoclassicalism style of writing.
- How do you think Romanticism changed peopleâ€™s perceptions of themselves and the world? 
  - Romanticism would allow people to view nature in a more beautiful light - allowing people to appreciate it more than they would without romanticism.
  - Romanticism was also used as an effort to stop the tide of increasing industrialism 
- Do people still think like Romantics? In what ways do we still live in a Romantic Age?

In summary, romanticism was mainly about a way of feeling rather than a way of expressing the scientific truths.
